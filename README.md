## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I've applied the learnings of React to sharpen my skills by solving the real-world problem. I basically learned when to render components & how exactly components are being rendered.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me with Javascript methods. I liked this pattern and will use it going forward.

## Acknowledgments

I learned ReactJS from ZTM ReactJS course. Hats off to the instructors for creating such a comprehensive tutorial. I understood almost every topic explained in the lecture videos. In addition to it, the MDN docs website helped me quite a lot for recalling the javascript methods required in this project.
